- 👋 Hi, I’m @Psycho42069, fake name. Real is too scary to link with this.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science in university second year.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing really, just want to do my own things.
- 📫 How to reach me, I'll try to check monthly on respositories.
